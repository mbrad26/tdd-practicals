## Test behaviour, not state.

Start writing a tic-tac-toe implementation, but only the first user stories:

* I can see the board on the screen
* I can put an X on the board

You might need more than one class for this, but you don't need to create them all up front if you don't want to.

Remember, test behaviour, not state. Go through the example again if you're not sure.
